If you want to create a dynamic and interactive website efficiently, then you should learn reactjs, and if you know about it, you should master these concepts to boost your react skills.

Frontend is one of the most in-demand skills in the tech industry. Reactjs is one of the most used and go-to frontend library for many javascript developers.

In this blog, I'll tell why you should learn reactjs as your first javascript framework and master these skills to become a good react developer.

Reactjs is an open-source frontend library for building UIs made by Facebook and released in 2013.

Frontend developers use it to build interactive web apps efficiently without writing a lot of vanilla JavaScript.

It becomes famous for creating reusable components in javascript functions with the JSX syntax language. When you assemble components, then it will become an entire web app.

In MVC (model-view-controller) architecture, react handles the view part of a web application. React encourages a developer to separate the complex UI features of a web app into many different blocks.

Reactjs combines the power of javascript with a more efficient way to manipulate DOM to render fast and help build a responsive web app.

There are many advantages of reactjs, but I'll tell you four widespread benefits of it in this blog.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Speed</h3>

Reactjs allows developers to create individual components that use on both the client-side (in the browser) and the server-side (on the web server), which eventually increases the whole development speed.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Flexibility</h3>

React's virtual DOM (Document Object Model) efficiently updates the UI (User Interface) components, reducing the need for manual updates and enhancing the overall performance of the web application, which is also a significant advantage for businesses.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Usability</h3>

Moreover, with the availability of various React-specific tools and libraries, such as Create React App and React Router, deploying and managing React-based applications has become even more streamlined and convenient for developers of varying levels of expertise.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Strong community support</h3>

The strong community support for react means there are numerous open-source React libraries and plugins available that can significantly reduce development time and effort.

Additionally, community-driven updates and bug fixes ensure that react based applications remain up-to-date and secure, making it a reliable and future-proof choice for businesses looking to build scalable and robust web applications.

There are many things that developers criticize about reactjs. I'll tell you four main criticisms related to it in this blog.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">JSX as a barrier</h3>

JSX is a syntax language that allows writing javascript into HTML. This approach is helpful for experienced developers, but JSX acts as a barrier for new developers because of its learning curve.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">View part</h3>

ReactJS focus on the UI layer means it is not a comprehensive solution for all aspects of app development.

Developers may need to integrate additional tools or technologies, such as state management libraries or back-end frameworks, to build a complete web application.

Integrating various libraries get tricky and troubling because you have to read much documentation and keep tracking all dependencies so it will not cause any security issues in your web app.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Lack of Documentation</h3>

React is an open-source library, and it changes and evolves at a very rapid pace. Because of rapid development, developers don't get enough time to write proper documentation. That's why you see many react libraries are not well documented.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">The high pace of development</h3>

The fast pace of React's development has both advantages and disadvantages. On the downside, the frequent changes to the framework can make some developers uncomfortable having to constantly relearn new ways of doing things.

It can be challenging for developers to keep updated with all react updates. So, many developers prefer to use an old method instead of updating their skills and learning new techniques.

Reactjs have many concepts, but these concepts help you become a better react developer. And help you create frontend applications fast and safely.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">JSX</h3>

<TopImage image={JSX} imageAlt="Reactjs JSX code syntax" load="lazy" />

JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred to as JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax.

It allows you to write JavaScript into your HTML template.

The benefits of learning it, helps you to create complex UIs and write javascript logic into your HTML without writing so much declarative code.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Reactjs Components</h3>

<TopImage image={Component} imageAlt="Reactjs Component" load="lazy" />

Understanding how to create, use and manage React components, which are the building blocks of any React application.

It allows you to break down complex UIs into small pieces so you will use it anywhere on your application.

The benefit of learning it, helps you save time writing the same thing many times and allow you to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">State Management</h3>

<TopImage image={Reactjs} imageAlt="Reactjs Code snippet" load="lazy" />

Knowing how to manage state in a react application using either react's built-in state management or external libraries such as Redux, MobX, etc.

It allows you to get data effortlessly in nested components instead of doing props drilling.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Reactjs Hooks</h3>

<TopImage image={Reactjs} imageAlt="Reactjs Code snippet" load="lazy" />

Understanding reacts hooks allow you to useState, and other React features without writing a class component.

It allows you to use complex features in one line of code, and you can create your custom hook to perform some specific task anywhere in your react application.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Server-Side Rendering</h3>

<TopImage image={Reactjs} imageAlt="Reactjs Code snippet" load="lazy" />

Familiarity with server-side rendering and how it can improve the performance and SEO of a react application.

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) allows you to process all complex processes on the server instead of doing all on the client side and giving the client a slow website.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Testing</h3>

<TopImage image={Reactjs} imageAlt="Reactjs Code snippet" load="lazy" />

Understanding how to write tests for react components using tools such as Jest, Enzyme, cypress, etc.

It allows you to automate end-user behavior so easily hunt bugs and create a safe web application.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Debugging</h3>

<TopImage image={Reactjs} imageAlt="Reactjs Code snippet" load="lazy" />

Knowing how to use debugging tools like the react Developer Tools extension for Chrome and Firefox.

It allows you to solve the error in your application efficiently by showing you which line of code causes the problem.
