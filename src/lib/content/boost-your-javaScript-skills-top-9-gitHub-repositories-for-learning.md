Javascript is high-level single-threaded garbage collected interpreted or JIT(Just-In-Time) complied prototype-based multi-paradigm dynamic language with non-blocking event loop made famous for building websites.

The definition of javascript sounds scary, but if you're a beginner, you don't have to focus on these complex words. It is just a thing that javascript does and a way of executing your code.

It was created in 1995 in just a week by Brendan Eich.

The main goal was to add an easy-to-learn scripting language for the Netscape browser.

It was initially named mocha, but marketing people made it sound like the 1990s sexy Java language.

Currently, it is a fully featured language according to <Link source="https://www.ecma-international.org/" title="Ecma" /> standards.

It is currently well known for making the frontend of the website. It is the only language, except for Web Assembly, that is native support in all browsers.

<blockquote class="pl-12 border-l-4 border-l-gray-500" ><p>Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood" class="hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" ><cite><strong> - Jeff Atwood</strong></cite></a></blockquote>

You can create server-side applications in NodeJs, mobile applications in react-native and iconic, and desktop applications in electron.

It is an interpreted scripting language, but tools like Google V8 engine and chromium use a JIT(Just-In-Time) compiler to execute your code at runtime. And also good at handling IO(Input-Output) intensive jobs.

Descript the fact it is a single-threaded language. It is all made possible by its non-blocking event loop, which queues your work in the background without blocking the main thread. Worldwide 97.7% of websites use it as their client-side language.

I think it is enough description to know about javascript if you're a beginner.

Let's first look at the advantages and disadvantages and then see where to learn it.

<SubHeading subHeading="Disadvantages of javascript" />

<Data>

There are many things that developers criticize about javascript. I'll tell you three main criticisms related to it in this blog.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Client-Side Security</h3>

Javascript code is viewable on the client-side computer that may use for malicious purposes if you don't write your code appropriately. It is easy to inject javascript into your website, which impairs the security of data sent and received by your website.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Lack of debugging facility</h3>

Executing javascript in HTML is hard to debug because the browser is a forgiving mistake of javascript, which leads to some strange behavior in your website. Nowadays, browsers provide lots of debugging tools, but it is hard for the beginner to understand, and it does not effective as other languages like java, C, and C++.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Browser Support</h3>

It is executed differently in different browsers. These days the difference is minimal. You have to test your script in various browsers and older versions because some features may not support that browser or that version.
