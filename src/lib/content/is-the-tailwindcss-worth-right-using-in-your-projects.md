When you develop a website, you have to make it responsive too. So, anyone can view your website with any device.

You have to use (media query) property in CSS to make your website responsive. The downside of using (media query) in vanilla CSS is that you have written more boilerplates in your CSS files.

Tailwindcss solves this problem by providing you with utility classes like (sm, md, and lg) or you can also introduce your breakpoint in the tailwind.

Tailwind has proven to be a stable framework developed by top-tier engineers. Currently, it is free of bugs, and you can use it in your production without any tension.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Highly customizable</h3>

<TopImage image={TailwindCode} imageAlt="tailwindcss syntax example" load="lazy" />

Because of the utility-first approach size of your HTML may get big due to an increase in class names in the HTML.

That can affect your download and render speed in the browser, which may give you performance issues.

Keep in mind tailwindcss provide rapid development, which increases your development speed. Additionally, the extra data in HTML is highly compressible, which can help you mitigate the performance.

<Data>

To use the tailwindcss in your project, you have to follow some steps to install tailwindcss in your project, which may be a little tricky for new developers, and learn how to change the tailwindcss configuration if you are not happy with the default settings.

Tailwindcss has a learning curve because you have to remember which utility class does what CSS property work.

You don't have to worry so much because tailwind has excellent documentation, and if you are using VScode, then you could use its powerful VScode extension.

<h3 class="font-bold text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl text-cyan-400 first:capitalize my-3">Tailwindcss doesn't do everything</h3>

<Data>

Default tailwind configuration comes with all widely used CSS properties. You may want to do some advanced CSS properties, and features are beyond the scope of the tailwind. You have to write custom CSS to solve this problem.
